# Cute-Tic-Tac-Toe
Welcome to my simple game Tic Tac Toe, This is a classic game with a different design which is the X is (´°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥ω°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥｀) then O is (⌐■_■) 
It is a 5x5 board that you can compete with your family and friends. For you to win you just need to have a straight 4 same symbol. 
Play until you win, draw, or reset the board to start again!

How to Play:
1. Enter names for Player X and Player O in the provided fields at the top of the game window.
2. Click on any empty cell in the 5x5 grid to place your mark (X or O). The current player's symbol will appear in the clicked cell.
3. Players alternate turns, with Player X starting first.
4. The first player to get five of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game.
5. If all cells are filled and no player has achieved five in a row, the game ends in a draw.
6. If you wish to undo your last move, click the "Undo" button. This will revert the last move and switch the turn back to the previous player.
7. To start a new game, click the "Reset" button. This clears the board, resets the history, and allows you to start fresh with Player X.
